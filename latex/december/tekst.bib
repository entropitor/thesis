abstract = {This technical report describes the discourse representation structures (DRS) derived from texts written in version 6.7 of Attempto Controlled English (ACE 6.7). The description is done by a set of examples. Among other things, ACE 6.7 supports modal statements, negation as failure, and sentence subordination. These features require an extended form of discourse representation structures. The discourse representation structure itself uses a reified, or ‘flat' notation, meaning that its atomic conditions are built from a small number of predefined predicates that take constants standing for words of the ACE text as their arguments.},

Furthermore, flexibility in contemporary WFMSs usually comes at a certain cost, such as lack of support for users, lack of methods for model analysis, lack of methods for analysis of past executions, etc. DECLARE is a proto-type of a WFMS that uses a constraint-based process modeling language for the development of declarative models describing loosely-structured processes. In this paper we show how DECLARE can support loosely-structured processes without sacrificing important WFMSs features like user support, model verification, analysis of past executions, changing models at run-time, etc.},

Moreover, the controlled natural language processor can be interfaced directly with an automated reasoner in order to resolve anaphoric references and to answer questions stated in PENG Light.},

(1999) have developed qualitative specification patterns to facilitate the specification of critical properties, such as those that must be satisfied by embedded systems. Thus far, no analogous repository has been compiled for realtime specification patterns. This paper makes two main contributions: First, based on an analysis of timing-based requirements of several industrial embedded system applications, we created real-time specification patterns in terms of three commonly used real-time temporal logics. Second, as a means to further facilitate the understanding of the meaning of a specification, we offer a structured English grammar that includes support for real-time properties. We illustrate the use of the real-time specification patterns in the context of property specifications of a real-world automotive embedded system.},

abstract = {This paper provides a gentle introduction to problem-solving with the IDP3 system. The core of IDP3 is a finite model generator that supports first-order logic enriched with types, inductive definitions, aggregates and partial functions. It offers its users a modeling language that is a slight extension of predicate logic and allows them to solve a wide range of search problems. Apart from a small introductory example, applications are selected from problems that arose within machine learning and data mining research. These research areas have recently shown a strong interest in declarative modeling and constraint-solving as opposed to algorithmic approaches. The paper illustrates that the IDP3 system can be a valuable tool for researchers with such an interest. The first problem is in the domain of stemmatology, a domain of philology concerned with the relationship between surviving variant versions of text. The second problem is about a somewhat related problem within biology where phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolution of species. The third and final problem concerns the classical problem of learning a minimal automaton consistent with a given set of strings. For this last problem, we show that the performance of our solution comes very close to that of the state-of-the art solution. For each of these applications, we analyze the problem, illustrate the development of a logic-based model and explore how alternatives can affect the performance.},

In this article, we present an approach for a natural language{\{}oriented representation of temporal logic formulae by introducing patterns of structured English sentences for Clocked CTL (CCTL) specication.

Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other.

Predictive editors are a popular approach to solve the problem that CNLs are easy to read but hard to write. Such predictive editors need to be able to "look ahead" in order to show all possible continuations of a given unfinished sentence. Such lookahead features, however, are difficult to implement in a satisfying way with existing grammar frameworks, especially if the CNL supports complex nonlocal structures such as anaphoric references. Here, methods and algorithms are presented for a new grammar notation called Codeco, which is specifically designed for controlled natural languages and predictive editors. A parsing approach for Codeco based on an extended chart parsing algorithm is presented. A large subset of Attempto Controlled English (ACE) has been represented in Codeco. Evaluation of this grammar and the parser implementation shows that the approach is practical, adequate and efficient.},

abstract = {Natural language processing is a prerequisite for advanced knowledge-based systems since the ability to acquire, retrieve, exploit and present knowledge critically depends on natural language comprehension and production. Natural language concepts guide the interpretation of what we see, hear, read, or experience with other senses. In the first part of the paper, we illustrate the needed capabilities of cooperative dialog systems with a detailed example: the interaction between a customer and a clerk at an information desk in a train station. It is shown, that natural language systems cannot just rely on knowledge about syntactical and semantical aspects of language but also have to exploit conceptual and inferential knowledge, and a user model. In the remainder, we analyze and evaluate three natural language systems which were introduced to the commercial market in 1985: Language Craft™ by Carnegie Group Inc., NLMenu by Texas Instruments Inc., and Q {\&} A™ by Symantec Inc. The detailed examination of these systems shows their capabilities and limitations. We conclude that the technology for limited natural language access systems is available now, but that in the forseeable future the capabilities of such systems in no way match human performance in face-to-face communication.},

abstract = {Object Constraint Language (OCL) is the only available language to annotate the Unified Modeling Language (UML) based conceptual schema (CS) of a software application. In practice, the constraints are captured in a natural language (NL) such as English and then an OCL expert manually transforms the NL expressions to OCL syntax. However, it is a common knowledge that OCL is difficult to write specifically for the novel users with little or no prior knowledge of OCL. In recent times, model transformation technology has made transformation of one language to another simpler and easier. In this paper we present a novel approach to automatically transform NL specification of software constraints to OCL constraints. In NL to OCL transformation, Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard is used as an intermediate representation due to a couple of reasons: first of all, SBVR is based on higher order logic that simplifies the transformation of SBVR to other formal languages such as OCL. Moreover, SBVR used syntax of natural language and thus is close to human beings. The presented NL to OCL transformation via SBVR will not only simplify the process of generating OCL constraints but also generate accurate models in less time.},

These tools have been used in several experiments both in academic and in industrial environments. Among other features, Circe can extract abstractions from natural language texts, build various models of the system described by the requirements, check the validity of such models, and produce functional metric reports.

The experience reported supports our position that it is feasible and useful to perform automated analysis of requirements expressed in natural language. Indeed, we identified a number of errors in our case study that were also independently discovered and corrected by NASA's Independent Validation and Verification Facility in a subsequent version of the same document, and others that were not discovered.

abstract = {Business rules represent the primary means by which companies define their business, perform their actions in order to reach their objectives. Thus, they need to be expressed unambiguously to avoid inconsistencies between business stakeholders and formally in order to be machine-processed. A promising solution is the use of a controlled natural language (CNL) which is a good mediator between natural and formal languages. This paper presents RuleCNL, which is a CNL for defining business rules. Its core feature is the alignment of the business rule definition with the business vocabulary which ensures traceability and consistency with the business domain. The RuleCNL tool provides editors that assist end-users in the writing process and automatic mappings into the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) standard. SBVR is grounded in first order logic and includes constructs called semantic formulations that structure the meaning of rules. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {The use of logic in identifying and analyzing inconsistency in requirements from multiple stakeholders has been found to be effective in a number of studies. Nonmonotonic logic is a theoretically well-founded formalism that is especially suited for supporting the evolution of requirements. However, direct use of logic for expressing requirements and discussing them with stakeholders poses serious usability problems, since in most cases stakeholders cannot be expected to be fluent with formal logic. In this article, we explore the integration of natural language parsing techniques with default reasoning to overcome these difficulties. We also propose a method for automatically discovering inconsistencies in the requirements from multiple stakeholders, using both theorem-proving and model-checking techniques, and show how to deal with them in a formal manner. These techniques were implemented and tested in a prototype tool called CARL. The effectiveness of the techniques and of the tool are illustrated by a classic example involving conflicting requirements from multiple stakeholders.},

abstract = {Numerous studies in recent months have proposed the use of linguistic instruments to support requirements analysis. There are two main reasons for this: (i) the progress made in natural language processing, (ii) the need to provide the developers of software systems with support in the early phases of requirements definition and conceptual modelling. This paper presents the results of an online market research intended (a) to assess the economic advantages of developing a CASE tool that integrates linguistic analysis techniques for documents written in natural language, and (b) to verify the existence of potential demand for such a tool. The research included a study of the language ranging from completely natural to highly restricted used in documents available for requirements analysis, an important factor given that on a technological level there is a trade-off between the language used and the performance of the linguistic instruments. To determine the potential demand for such tool, some of the survey questions dealt with the adoption of development methodologies and consequently with models and support tools; other questions referred to activities deemed critical by the companies involved. Through statistical correspondence analysis of the responses, we were able to outline two "profiles" of companies that correspond to two potential market niches which are characterised by their very different approach to software development.},

abstract = {This handbook is about writing software requirements specifications and legal contracts, two kinds of docu- ments with similar needs for completeness, consistency, and precision. Particularly when these are written, as they usually are, in natural language, ambiguity—by any definition—is a major cause of their not specifying what they should. Simple misuse of the language in which the document is written is one source of these ambiguities. This handbook describes the ambiguity phenomenon from several points of view, including linguistics, software engineering, and the law. Several strategies for avoiding and detecting ambiguities are presented. Strong emphasis is given on the problems arising from the use of heavily used and seemingly unambiguous words and phrases such as “all”, “each”, and “every” in defining or referencing sets; positioning of “only”, “also”, and “even”; precedences of “and” and “or”; “a”, “all”, “any”, “each”, “one”, “some”, and “the” used as quantifiers; “or” and “and/or”; “that” vs. “which”; parallelism; pronouns referring to an idea; multiple adjectives; etc. Many examples from requirements documents and legal documents are examined. While no guide can overcome the careless or indifferent writer, this handbook is offered as a guide both for writing better requirements or contracts and for inspecting them for potential ambiguities. 1},

Instead of using formal languages that are difficult to learn and to remember for non-specialists, authors should be able to write specifications texts in a well-defined subset of English that can be unambiguously processed by a computer. This subset of computer-processable English (PENG) consists of a restricted grammar and lexicon and is used together with an intelligent text editor that guides the writing process. The editor of the PENG system communicates with a language processor that generates logical structures while the author writes a specification text. The language processor is connected via a server with reasoning services that allow for acceptability checking and question answering. Texts written in PENG look seemingly informal and are easy to write and understand for humans but have first-order equivalent properties.},
