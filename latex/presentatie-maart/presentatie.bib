abstract = {The importance of requirements, which in practice often means natural language requirements, for a successful software project cannot be underestimated. Although requirement analysis has been traditionally reserved to the experience of professionals, there is no reason not to use various automatic techniques to the same end. In this paper we present Circe, a Web-based environment for aiding in natural language requirements gathering, elicitation, selection, and validation and the tools it integrates. These tools have been used in several experiments both in academic and in industrial environments. Among other features, Circe can extract abstractions from natural language texts, build various models of the system described by the requirements, check the validity of such models, and produce functional metric reports. The environment can be easily extended to enhance its natural language recognition power or to add new models and views on them},

abstract = {Model checking has received wide acceptance as a valuable technique in the eld of electronic design automation and is currently of growing interest in general systems design. Though its concepts and applications are well understood it often turns out that engineers have severe problems with the specication process and the underlying notation, i.e., formulation and understanding of specications through means of temporal logic formulae. In this article, we present an approach for a natural language{\{}oriented representation of temporal logic formulae by introducing patterns of structured English sentences for Clocked CTL (CCTL) specication. After outlining the basic patterns of the sentences we give their semantics by a translation to CCTL. A final example demonstrates their application. }},

@article{Konrad2005,
abstract = {Embedded systems are pervasive and frequently used for critical systems with time-dependent functionality. Dwyer et al. (1999) have developed qualitative specification patterns to facilitate the specification of critical properties, such as those that must be satisfied by embedded systems. Thus far, no analogous repository has been compiled for realtime specification patterns. This paper makes two main contributions: First, based on an analysis of timing-based requirements of several industrial embedded system applications, we created real-time specification patterns in terms of three commonly used real-time temporal logics. Second, as a means to further facilitate the understanding of the meaning of a specification, we offer a structured English grammar that includes support for real-time properties. We illustrate the use of the real-time specification patterns in the context of property specifications of a real-world automotive embedded system.},

@article{Luisa2004,
abstract = {Numerous studies in recent months have proposed the use of linguistic instruments to support requirements analysis. There are two main reasons for this: (i) the progress made in natural language processing, (ii) the need to provide the developers of software systems with support in the early phases of requirements definition and conceptual modelling. This paper presents the results of an online market research intended (a) to assess the economic advantages of developing a CASE tool that integrates linguistic analysis techniques for documents written in natural language, and (b) to verify the existence of potential demand for such a tool. The research included a study of the language ranging from completely natural to highly restricted used in documents available for requirements analysis, an important factor given that on a technological level there is a trade-off between the language used and the performance of the linguistic instruments. To determine the potential demand for such tool, some of the survey questions dealt with the adoption of development methodologies and consequently with models and support tools; other questions referred to activities deemed critical by the companies involved. Through statistical correspondence analysis of the responses, we were able to outline two "profiles" of companies that correspond to two potential market niches which are characterised by their very different approach to software development.},

Moreover, the controlled natural language processor can be interfaced directly with an automated reasoner in order to resolve anaphoric references and to answer questions stated in PENG Light.},

@article{Bruynooghe2014,
abstract = {This paper provides a gentle introduction to problem-solving with the IDP3 system. The core of IDP3 is a finite model generator that supports first-order logic enriched with types, inductive definitions, aggregates and partial functions. It offers its users a modeling language that is a slight extension of predicate logic and allows them to solve a wide range of search problems. Apart from a small introductory example, applications are selected from problems that arose within machine learning and data mining research. These research areas have recently shown a strong interest in declarative modeling and constraint-solving as opposed to algorithmic approaches. The paper illustrates that the IDP3 system can be a valuable tool for researchers with such an interest. The first problem is in the domain of stemmatology, a domain of philology concerned with the relationship between surviving variant versions of text. The second problem is about a somewhat related problem within biology where phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolution of species. The third and final problem concerns the classical problem of learning a minimal automaton consistent with a given set of strings. For this last problem, we show that the performance of our solution comes very close to that of the state-of-the art solution. For each of these applications, we analyze the problem, illustrate the development of a logic-based model and explore how alternatives can affect the performance.},
