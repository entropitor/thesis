# Holygrail

This repo contains the code + report for my Master Thesis ["Automatic Translation of Logic Grid Puzzles into a Typed Logic"](https://github.com/entropitor/thesis/blob/master/deliverables/0masterproef-merged.pdf).

Make sure to also check out the extension of this work at https://github.com/bartbog/holygrail/ with which we won [The 2019 Holy Grail Challenge](https://freuder.wordpress.com/pthg-19-the-third-workshop-on-progress-towards-the-holy-grail/). 

## Directory Structure
```

│   └── graphviz                           The graphviz files used for the poster
└── src                                  The source code used up until december (not using Blackburn & Bos)
```

## Installing Dependencies
To be able to run the code from Bos, one would need:
  - docker (to run [IDP](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/idp), the constraint solver solving the puzzle)
  - NodeJS
  - SWI Prolog

## Running the code
### Setup
Move into the `bos/` directory. If you don't want to answers any questions, use the example `cachedAnswers.pl` provided
```sh
cd bos
cp output/cachedAnswers.pl.example output/cachedAnswers.pl
```

### Run
*Be sure to be in the `bos/` directory!*

To actually run a problem (this will parse everything and try to solve the puzzle as well):
```sh
swipl -g "solvep(problem_name)" -g halt main.pl
```

To do this for all puzzles:
```sh
swipl -g "solveAll" -g halt main.pl
```

To just test the parsing of a puzzle:
```sh
swipl -g "testAll([problem_name])" -g halt main.pl
```
## Adding a problem
One can add a problem by adding a fact in `problems.pl`.

```prolog
problem(problem_name, problem(NbTypes, NbEntitiesPerType, Sentences, Lexicon)).
```
